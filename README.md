# iMDex

iMDex will eventually be a one-stop-shop for all things related to markdown indexing.
Currently it consists of 3 different types of parts.

 - The server (only one of these currently)
 - Indexers that insert/update content (a couple of these)
 - Clients/UI (currently web, cmd, and terminal UI exist)

 There are a few gaps in its functionality, but at the time of initial import/upload
 iMDex is capable of indexing, searching, and rendering markdown files with links between
 them. Eventually this will be expanded to provide better searching/crossreferencing across links
 and better editing of content within iMDex (which is currently basically import only).
